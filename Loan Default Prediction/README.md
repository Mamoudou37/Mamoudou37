# Loan default prediction
The loan approval process is a major concern for banks. Banks put effort into checking creditworthiness to avoid bad debts, but the process is prone to misjudgments. With data science and machine learning, the focus has shifted to building machines that make the approval process bias-free and efficient. The goal of the project is to build a model that predicts loan defaults and advises banks on key variables to consider.

## Skills & Tools Covered
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Trees
- Random Forest
- Hyperparameter Tuning
- Exploratory Data Analysis

## My Learnings
The Random Forest model with hyperparameter tuning is proposed to predict loan defaults. The use of techniques such as class weights and GridSearchCV have led to improved performance, better accuracy and recall of ~87% and ~78% respectively, compared to other models, providing a more accurate prediction of defaulted loans. However, the model's limitations such as missing data and outliers must be considered in the loan approval process, particularly the Debt-to-Income Ratio variable.
